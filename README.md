# MERN_Training

Welcome to the **MERN_Training** repository!  
This project is a hands-on training repository to learn and practice full-stack web development using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)  
- **Other:**  
  - Axios (for API calls)  
  - JWT (for authentication, if implemented)  
  - Nodemon (for development)

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santhu643/MERN_Training.git
````

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd MERN_Training/backend
npm install
```

* Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
```

* Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

Open a new terminal window/tab:

```bash
cd MERN_Training/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will run at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API will run at `http://localhost:5000`.
